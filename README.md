# JokeTeller

This is a fun joke teller using VoiceRSS as a text-speech translator and https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/ as a joke source API

Currently it only works on PC browsers, smartphone are not supported to use the audio function I implement.

Just click on the button to get a random joke to make your life happier for a few second

You can see a demo on https://felixchenc.github.io/JokeTeller/
